## üéÆ How to Play

The objective of the game is to control the snake and eat as many food items as possible. Each time the snake eats a food item, it grows longer, making the game more challenging. The game ends when the snake collides with the game window border or with its own body.

- Use the LEFT arrow key to move the snake to the left.
- Use the RIGHT arrow key to move the snake to the right.
