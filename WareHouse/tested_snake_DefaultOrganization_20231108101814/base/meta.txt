Task:
Develop the game Snake using Python, based upon pygame. Be meticulous and incredibly insightful while designing and writing the Python code. Apply the SOLID principles meticulously and with expert-level perception and insight.
I have prepared an extensive and detailed break-down of the game dynamics, as requirements:

**1. Gameplay Dynamics**

The fundamental gameplay dynamics of Snake involve guiding a snake through a bounded plane, collecting items, and avoiding collision with the snake's own body and walls. The following breakdown elucidates these dynamics in detail:

**1.1 Movement Mechanics**

- **Directional Control**: The snake is directed using either keyboard arrows, swipe gestures on a touchscreen, or other input devices, depending on the platform. The snake can move up, down, left, or right, and cannot stop once it starts moving.
- **Continual Motion**: Once the game begins, the snake moves continuously and only changes direction upon player input.
- **Grid Movement**: In traditional Snake games, the playing field is conceptualized as a grid, and the snake's movement is typically constrained to the grid lines. The snake moves one grid unit per frame.
- **Turning Restrictions**: The snake cannot reverse direction 180 degrees. For example, if moving right, it cannot immediately move left.

**1.2 Growth and Food Mechanics**

- **Food Items**: Usually represented by dots or apples, food items appear on the playing field at random or predetermined locations.
- **Growth Trigger**: When the snake's head occupies the same grid space as the food, the snake consumes the food, triggering growth.
- **Incremental Growth**: Each food item typically increases the snake's length by one unit. This is often represented by an additional segment added to the snake's tail end after consumption.
- **Food Respawn**: After a food item is consumed, a new item appears somewhere else on the playing field.

**2. Level Design**

The environment in which Snake is played can greatly influence the gameplay experience.

**2.1 Playing Field Variations**

- **Size Variations**: Playing fields can range from small to large, affecting the difficulty and strategy. Smaller fields increase the difficulty as the snake has less space to navigate.
- **Shape Variations**: While most Snake games use a rectangular field, some variations may feature different shapes, adding complexity to the navigation.

**2.2 Obstacles and Challenges**

- **Static Obstacles**: Some versions include permanent obstacles that the snake must navigate around.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Other versions may include moving obstacles or enemies that the snake must avoid, introducing additional layers of difficulty.
- **Border Interaction**: The game might end if the snake hits the border (classic mode) or the snake might wrap around and re-enter the field from the opposite side (borderless mode).

**3. Control Scheme**

The control scheme is a critical component that dictates how the snake is manipulated by the player.

**3.1 Input Methods**

- **Keyboard**: Using arrow keys to change direction.
- **Touchscreen**: Swiping in the desired direction.
- **Gyroscope**: Tilting the device (in some mobile versions).
- **Mouse**: Clicking in the direction relative to the snake's position (less common).

**3.2 Responsiveness**

- **Input Lag**: The delay between input and action must be minimal to ensure a responsive control experience.
- **Frame Rate**: A higher frame rate allows for smoother movement and more precise control, important as the snake speeds up.
- **Queueing Inputs**: Some versions allow the player to queue a turn, so the snake will turn at the next available opportunity.

**4. Difficulty Progression**

The challenge in Snake comes from both the growing length of the snake and the increasing speed of the game.

**4.1 Speed Increment**

- **Constant Increase**: In some games, speed gradually increases over time or as the snake consumes more food.
- **Level Thresholds**: Others may increase speed only after reaching certain score thresholds or levels.

**4.2 Size Management**

- **Navigation Skills**: As the snake grows, the player must become more skillful in navigating the snake's body.
- **Strategic Turning**: Implementing patterns or specific turning strategies to avoid collision becomes crucial.
- **Space Awareness**: The player must remain constantly aware of the space available versus the snake's length.

**5. Scoring System**

The scoring system in Snake serves as the player's feedback mechanism and incentive for progression.

- **Points per Food**: Typically, each food item increases the player's score. The score increment might be a constant number or could increase with difficulty.
- **Level Completion**: If the game has distinct levels, completing a level might award bonus points.
- **Bonus Items**: Some versions include special food items that provide more points or additional effects when consumed.
- **Score Multipliers**: Implementing multipliers for successive food items consumed within a short time frame can add a layer of strategic scoring.
- **High Score**: High scores are often recorded as a means of competition. This can be local, on a single device, or global, with an online leaderboard.

The design of Snake's game mechanics creates a deceptively simple yet engaging and challenging gameplay experience that has maintained its popularity over decades. Each of these elements plays a crucial role in the game's enduring appeal and the depth of strategy involved in mastering the game.
