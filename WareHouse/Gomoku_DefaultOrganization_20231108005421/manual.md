# Snake Game

A classic Snake game developed using Python and Pygame. Navigate the snake to eat the food and grow while avoiding collision with the snake's own body and the walls.

## Quick Install

Before you can run the game, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install Pygame, which is the only dependency for this game.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

The game is controlled using the arrow keys on your keyboard:

- **Up Arrow**: Move the snake upwards.
- **Down Arrow**: Move the snake downwards.
- **Left Arrow**: Move the snake to the left.
- **Right Arrow**: Move the snake to the right.

The game starts immediately when you run the program. The snake moves continuously in the direction of the last arrow key pressed.

The objective of the game is to eat as many food items as possible. Each food item is represented by a red square that appears randomly on the playing field. When the snake eats a food item, it grows by one segment and a new food item appears.

The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or with its own body.

## üöÄ Running the Game

To run the game, navigate to the directory containing the game files in your terminal and run the following command:

`python main.py`

This will start the game. Enjoy!

## üìà Scoring System

The scoring system in the Snake game serves as the player's feedback mechanism and incentive for progression.

- **Points per Food**: Each food item increases the player's score. The score increment is a constant number.
- **High Score**: High scores are recorded as a means of competition. This can be local, on a single device.

## üéÆ Game Dynamics

The game dynamics of Snake involve guiding a snake through a bounded plane, collecting items, and avoiding collision with the snake's own body and walls. The snake moves one grid unit per frame and cannot reverse direction 180 degrees. For example, if moving right, it cannot immediately move left.

The environment in which Snake is played can greatly influence the gameplay experience. The playing field is a rectangular field. The game ends if the snake hits the border.

The challenge in Snake comes from both the growing length of the snake and the increasing speed of the game. As the snake grows, the player must become more skillful in navigating the snake's body.

## üõ†Ô∏è Game Development

The Snake game is developed using Python and Pygame. The game follows the SOLID principles and is designed with meticulous and expert-level perception and insight. The code is organized into separate modules for the main game, the snake, and the food, making it easy to understand and modify.
