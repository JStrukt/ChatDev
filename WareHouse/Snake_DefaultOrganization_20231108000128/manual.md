## How to Play

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can start playing the Snake Game. Follow the steps below to launch the game and control the snake:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the Snake Game files.

3. Run the following command to start the game:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   This will launch the Snake Game window.

4. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's movement. The snake can move up, down, left, or right. Avoid colliding with walls and your own body.

5. The objective of the game is to eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer. Try to eat as much food as possible without colliding with obstacles.

6. The game ends if the snake collides with a wall or its own body. Your score will be displayed on the screen.

7. To play again, simply close the game window and run the `python main.py` command again.

## Game Dynamics

The Snake Game follows the classic gameplay dynamics of guiding a snake through a bounded plane, collecting food, and avoiding collisions. Here are some key aspects of the game dynamics:

- **Movement Mechanics**: Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement. The snake moves continuously and can only change direction upon player input. The movement is constrained to a grid, and the snake moves one grid unit per frame.

- **Growth and Food Mechanics**: Food items appear on the playing field at random locations. When the snake's head occupies the same grid space as the food, the snake consumes the food and grows longer. After consuming food, a new item appears somewhere else on the playing field.

- **Level Design**: The game can be played on different playing field variations, including different sizes and shapes. Some variations may include static or dynamic obstacles that the snake must navigate around. The game may also have different border interactions, such as ending the game when the snake hits the border or allowing the snake to wrap around and re-enter the field from the opposite side.

- **Control Scheme**: The snake can be controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard. Other input methods, such as touchscreen swipes or mouse clicks, may be available depending on the platform.

- **Difficulty Progression**: The game becomes more challenging as the snake grows longer and the speed of the game increases. The speed may gradually increase over time or after reaching certain score thresholds or levels. As the snake grows, the player must become more skillful in navigating the snake's body and avoiding collisions.

- **Scoring System**: Each food item increases the player's score. The score increment may be a constant number or increase with difficulty. Completing levels or consuming special food items may award bonus points. High scores can be recorded for competition.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You are now ready to play the Snake Game. Follow the installation instructions and start enjoying this classic arcade game. Have fun and challenge yourself to achieve the highest score!
